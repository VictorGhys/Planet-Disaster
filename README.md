# Planet Disaster
Planet Disaster is a 3D chaotic story driven puzzle game. In the game disasters spawn on the earth and you need to fix them by combining them. In the story you are employed by an omnipresent being and your job is to protect a planet from natural disasters. This was the first time that I tried to add a story to my game and coded a dialogue system. This was a very fun project to work on. The game was 291th out of 1750 entries which is in the top 16%.

The game was made for brackeys game jam 2021.2 over the course of one week. The theme was "Let there be chaos". Made in Unity.
